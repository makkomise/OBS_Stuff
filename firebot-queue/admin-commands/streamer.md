# Streamer

**!queue key "room-pass-code"** - changes the passcode used that gets sent to the invited players via whisper. Use without quotes. NOTE: DO NOT SEND THIS MESSAGE IN YOUR CHAT, WHISPER THIS TO THE BOT. Otherwise everyone will see your code, duh.

Example: _!queue key peepee-poopoo_



**!queue "number"** - selects the designated amount of people from the top of the list, sends them the room code via Twitch whisper and deletes them from the line. Also sends a chat message saying how many people are selected and dinkdonks (message can be customized (here))

Example: _!queue 69_ (sends the code for 69 people in your list if you have so many in the queue)
