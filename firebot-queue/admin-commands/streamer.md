# Streamer

**!queue key "room-pass-code"** - changes the passcode used that gets sent to the invited players via whisper. Use without quotes. NOTE: DO NOT SEND THIS MESSAGE IN YOUR CHAT, WHISPER THIS TO THE BOT. Otherwise everyone will see your code, duh.

Example: _!queue key peepee-poopoo_



**!queue pick \[number]** - selects the designated amount of people from the top of the list, sends them the room code via Twitch whisper and deletes them from the line. Also sends a chat message saying how many people are selected and dinkdonks.

**Example: **_**!queue pick 69**_ (sends the code for 69 people in your list if you have so many in the queue)

**NOTICE:** Please for the love of god only use numbers. I warned ya.
