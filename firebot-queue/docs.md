# Setting up

* Download the setup.zip (Click on [this link](../Firebot%20Queue/setup.zip), press "view raw")
* Unpack the zip to the root of your C:\ directory (so it'd be C:\OBS\\) OPTIONAL: If you want to unpack it to your preferred place, don't forget to change the scripts (explained in detail [here](https://makko.gitbook.io/makkos-obs-stuff/firebot-queue/customization/changing-the-directory-of-scripts))
* Open up firebot, go to settings -> Setups -> Import setup
* Choose File "Queues.firebotsetup"
* You should be good to go!
