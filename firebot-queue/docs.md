# Setting up

* Download the setup.zip (Click on [this link](../Firebot%20Queue/setup.zip), press "view raw")
* Unpack the zip to the root of your C:\ directory (so it'd be C:\OBS\\) OPTIONAL: If you want to unpack it to your preferred place, don't forget to change the scripts (insert link to manual here)
* Open up firebot, go to settings -> Setups -> Import setup
* Choose File "Queues.firebotsetup"
* You should be good to go!
