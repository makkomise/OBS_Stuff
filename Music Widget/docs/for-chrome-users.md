# For Chrome users

Unfortunately this widget is not yet available in the Chrome Extensions, due to me refusing to pay to get access to their dev portal ":D". But that doesn't mean you can't install this on Chrome, i've tested this to work on that browser also, but installing is a bit different:

1. Download and unpack the ZIP (Click on [nowPlayingWidget.zip](Music%20Widget/nowPlayingWidget.zip), view raw.)
2. Open chrome, go to Extensions -> Manage Extensions, click on slider top right to enable Developer mode
3. Click "Load unpacked" At the top
4. Find your uncompressed folder, press select folder
5. Profit????
