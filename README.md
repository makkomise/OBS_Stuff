# Music Widget

This is a fork from Tuna's TamperMonkey script, i just cleaned off everything i don't need and made it into standalone extension.

tunaWidget.html made by Kagashin, all credit to him. Just here for easy access.

Why? Because YT Music lacks native app, and i have a distrust on 3rd party apps, and also chromium-based apps can do pwa so that's why this exists.

Now available for Microsoft Edge in Edge's Addons: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ytmusic\_obs/fmgcoomclaaobpkbojgpdmjjnkdoebja
