This is a fork from Tuna's TamperMonkey script, i just cleaned off everything i don't need.
Widget made by Kagashin, all credit to him. Just here for easy access.

Why? Because YT Music lacks native app, and i have a distrust on 3rd party apps, and also chromium-based apps can do pwa so that's why this exists.

Quick Summary:

1) Install YT App on Edge
2) Install TamperMonkey to Edge
3) Click on tuna_browser_user.js, Click "Raw" and it installs the script to your Edge
4) Goto your YTM App, Click on Extensions -> TamperMonkey to enable it in the app, also make sure the script is running (if not, try restarting the app)
5) From your Tuna settings, make sure Source is set to Browser source
6) Download widget.html, add that as your Browser Source in OBS (600x250)
