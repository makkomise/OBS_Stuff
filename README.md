This is a fork from Tuna's TamperMonkey script, i just cleaned off everything i don't need and made it into standalone extension
tunaWidget.html made by Kagashin, all credit to him. Just here for easy access.

Why? Because YT Music lacks native app, and i have a distrust on 3rd party apps, and also chromium-based apps can do pwa so that's why this exists.

Quick Summary:

1) Download and unpack the ZIP (Click on nowPlayingWidget.zip, view raw.)
2) Edge: go to Extensions -> Manage Extensions, click on the left side slider to enable Developer mode
   Chrome: Extensions -> Manage Extensions, click on slider top right to enable Developer mode
4) Click "Load unpacked" At the top
5) Find your uncompressed folder, press select folder
6) Profit????

Optional steps for using YTMusic as a standalone Desktop App:

1) In edge OR chrome, go to music.youtube.com
2) Click on "Install App" on the Address bar
3) Optionally, pin to start or taskbar
4) In the app, click on the three little dots in upper right corner, check that OBS_Extension is there, and you should be good to go!
5) Profit again?????

In OBS, just make sure you are using Web Browser as a Song source in Tuna settings, and add kagachad's tunaWidget.html as a Browser Source into one or your Scenes
